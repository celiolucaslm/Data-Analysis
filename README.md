# Data Analysis of users Amazon Prime

This project aims to describe a dataset of Amazon Prime users provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnavsmayan/amazon-prime-userbase-dataset). The project involves data cleaning, followed by exploratory data analysis in this [notebook](https://github.com/celiolucaslm/Data-Analysis/blob/main/amazon_prime.ipynb).

To present the key insights gathered during the analysis, an interactive dashboard was built using the [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com) library. The dashboard was designed to be both clear and easy to navigate, while also allowing users to interact with the displayed information dynamically.

Below is a breakdown of how the information is structured.

- This section presents the most relevant data on customer interactions with the platform. It includes insights on the most subscribed plans, how users renew their memberships based on platform engagement, usage frequency, purchase history, favorite genres, and the primary devices used to access the platform.

- Only users falling into this category are counted and displayed to help various departments (e.g., product, marketing, sales) take action to retain them.

- Additionally, there is a chart showing the distribution of customer interactions with support services, which is important for understanding how the platform is performing from a business perspective.
