# Data Analysis of users Amazon Prime

This project aims to describe a dataset of Amazon Prime users provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnavsmayan/amazon-prime-userbase-dataset). The project involves data cleaning, followed by exploratory data analysis in this [notebook](https://github.com/celiolucaslm/Data-Analysis/blob/main/amazon_prime.ipynb).

To present the key insights gathered during the analysis, an interactive dashboard was built using the [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com) library. The dashboard was designed to be both clear and easy to navigate, while also allowing users to interact with the displayed information dynamically.

Below is a breakdown of how the information is structured.

- Additionally, there is a chart showing the distribution of customer interactions with support services, which is important for understanding how the platform is performing from a business perspective.
